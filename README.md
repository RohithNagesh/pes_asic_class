# VLSI Physical Design for ASICs
The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to transform a digital circuit's logical representation into a physical layout that meets various performance, power, area, and manufacturability requirements.
